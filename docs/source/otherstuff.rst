Why Wolta name?
________________

In early 2024, I watched a movie called The Peasants at the theatre, and I really loved it. There was a wolta dance scene and I wanted to name my library with this name.

Radiohead
____________

While creating Wolta, I listened to Radiohead a lot. Which is why, I will give a place to these great band with my favorite Radiohead album:
